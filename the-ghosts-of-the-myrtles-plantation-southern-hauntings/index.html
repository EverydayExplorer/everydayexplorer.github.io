However, behind its picturesque façade lies a darker side; a side that is believed to be haunted by the ghosts of its past. The Myrtles Plantation is often considered one of the most haunted locations in the United States, and its legends and ghost stories continue to fascinate visitors from all over the world.</p><p>The plantation dates back to the late 18th century when General David Bradford, also known as &lsquo;Whiskey Dave,&rsquo; acquired the land and built a small cottage. Over time, the property grew and evolved, eventually becoming a grand plantation house. With its sprawling grounds, elegant architecture, and lush gardens, it is no wonder that the Myrtles Plantation has captured the imagination of so many.</p><p>One of the most famous ghost stories associated with the Myrtles Plantation is that of Chloe, a former slave who is said to have been involved in a tragic incident. Legend has it that Chloe, who was treated as a mistress by the plantation owner, was caught eavesdropping on a conversation. In an attempt to teach Chloe a lesson, one of her ears was reportedly cut off. Seeking revenge, Chloe supposedly baked a poisoned cake that unintentionally killed two of the family members. After her involvement was discovered, Chloe was hanged from a tree on the grounds.</p><p>Chloe is believed to still roam the Myrtles Plantation, appearing as a ghostly figure in a green turban and a long, flowing green dress. Many visitors have reported seeing her wandering the halls of the plantation or standing by windows, looking out onto the grounds. Others claim to have heard her voice or even felt her presence nearby. The ghost of Chloe has become an integral part of the Myrtles Plantation&rsquo;s history and continues to captivate those who visit.</p><p>Another paranormal phenomenon associated with the Myrtles Plantation is the presence of several children&rsquo;s spirits. Many guests claim to have heard the sound of children laughing or crying, seen small handprints on mirrors, or felt a tug on their clothing. One popular theory is that these spirits are the children of Sara Woodruff, who once lived on the plantation. According to the legend, Sara was distraught over the death of her children and fell into a deep depression. It is believed that her children&rsquo;s spirits have never left the plantation and continue to linger, seeking comfort and companionship.</p><p>In addition to Chloe and the children&rsquo;s spirits, there are many other ghostly tales associated with the Myrtles Plantation. The ghost of William Drew Winter, a former owner of the plantation, is said to have been shot on the front porch and makes his presence known through the sound of footsteps and eerie voices. The spirits of slaves who once labored on the plantation are also believed to still be present, with numerous reports of ghostly apparitions and unexplained sounds coming from the slave quarters. With so many ghostly experiences reported, it is no wonder that the Myrtles Plantation has become a popular destination for those seeking a glimpse into the paranormal world.</p><p>The Myrtles Plantation has embraced its haunted reputation and offers ghost tours and overnight stays for those brave enough to experience the paranormal activity firsthand. The current owners even conducted extensive research and investigations to document the various supernatural occurrences reported at the property. These efforts have made the Myrtles Plantation a hotspot for paranormal enthusiasts and thrill-seekers alike.</p><p>The stories of the ghosts of the Myrtles Plantation have been passed down through generations, captivating the imagination of locals and visitors alike. Whether you are a skeptic or a believer, there is no denying the mystique and intrigue that surrounds this historical landmark. The spirits that are said to inhabit the Myrtles Plantation continue to draw curious souls from all walks of life, eager to experience the supernatural for themselves.</p><p>So, if you find yourself craving an adventure into the unknown, consider visiting the Myrtles Plantation.
