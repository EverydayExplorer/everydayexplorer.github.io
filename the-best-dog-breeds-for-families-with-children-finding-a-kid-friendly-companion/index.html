They are loyal, patient, and extremely affectionate, making them great family dogs. Golden Retrievers love being around people, especially children, and they thrive on companionship. They are known for their patience with kids and are often willing to put up with ear tugs and tail pulls without showing any signs of aggression. With their intelligence and willingness to please, Golden Retrievers are a popular choice for families seeking a kid-friendly companion.</p><h2 id=beagle>Beagle</h2><p>Beagles may be small in size, but they have big hearts and an incredible love for children.
