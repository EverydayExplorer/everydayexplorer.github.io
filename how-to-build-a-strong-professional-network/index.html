This exchange can lead to personal growth and new perspectives in your field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Support System</strong>: Building relationships can create a support network that provides encouragement during challenging times, whether it&rsquo;s job loss, career transitions, or personal setbacks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increased Visibility</strong>: A strong network enhances your visibility in your industry, leading to potential collaborations, partnerships, and recognition.</p></li></ul><h2 id=step-1-define-your-networking-goals>Step 1: Define Your Networking Goals</h2><p>Before you start networking, it’s essential to have a clear understanding of your goals.
