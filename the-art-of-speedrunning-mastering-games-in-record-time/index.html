This practice involves completing a game as quickly as possible, often exploiting glitches, shortcuts, and a variety of strategies to achieve the best time. In recent years, speedrunning has gained immense popularity, drawing in a vast community of gamers who share tips, techniques, and their personal bests. This blog post delves into the art of speedrunning, exploring its history, techniques, and the vibrant community that surrounds it.</p><h2 id=what-is-speedrunning>What is Speedrunning?</h2><p>At its core, speedrunning is the art of completing a video game in the shortest time possible. Players dedicate themselves to mastering every aspect of a game, from level layouts to enemy behavior. The objective is not only to finish the game but to do so in record time, often competing against others or oneself in a quest for improvement.</p><p>Speedrunning can be categorized into several formats:</p><ul><li><strong>Any%:</strong> Complete the game as quickly as possible, using any means necessary, including glitches.</li><li><strong>100%:</strong> Complete the game while achieving all objectives, collecting every item, and completing all side quests.</li><li><strong>Glitchless:</strong> Finish the game without using any glitches or exploits, relying solely on skill and strategy.</li></ul><p>Each category offers its own challenges and attracts different types of players.</p><h2 id=a-brief-history-of-speedrunning>A Brief History of Speedrunning</h2><p>The roots of speedrunning can be traced back to the early days of gaming. As players began to share their experiences and achievements, the concept of completing games faster than others emerged. The first recorded speedrun is often attributed to the classic game &ldquo;Super Mario Bros.&rdquo; in the mid-1980s. Players started timing their runs and sharing them on bulletin boards and forums.</p><p>As technology advanced and the internet became more accessible, speedrunning communities began to form. Websites like Speedrun.com emerged, providing a platform for players to submit their times, share strategies, and connect with others who share their passion.</p><p>In 2010, the advent of live streaming platforms such as Twitch propelled speedrunning into the mainstream. Gamers began broadcasting their runs live, allowing viewers to witness the excitement of racing against the clock in real-time. Events like Games Done Quick further popularized the community by showcasing speedruns for charity, attracting massive audiences and raising millions.</p><h2 id=the-techniques-behind-speedrunning>The Techniques Behind Speedrunning</h2><p>Speedrunning requires a combination of technical skill, game knowledge, and mental fortitude. Here are some essential techniques that aspiring speedrunners should master:</p><h3 id=1-route-optimization>1. <strong>Route Optimization</strong></h3><p>One of the first steps in speedrunning is to determine the most efficient route through the game.
