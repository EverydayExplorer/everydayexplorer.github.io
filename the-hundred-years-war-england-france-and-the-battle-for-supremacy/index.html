This series of battles, skirmishes, and diplomatic maneuverings began in 1337 and continued until 1453, with a brief respite during the 50-year peace treaty from 1396 to 1444. The war was a struggle for supremacy between the two nations, with each side seeking to dominate the other and establish its own hegemony over Europe.</p><p>The conflict was sparked by a dispute over the French throne, which had been vacant since the death of King Charles IV in 1328. Edward III of England, who was a cousin of the deceased king, claimed the throne, but was opposed by Philip VI of France, who was a distant relative of the king. The English monarch believed that he had a stronger claim to the throne due to his descent from the French royal line, and therefore launched a military campaign to assert his rights.</p><p>The early years of the war saw a series of English victories, including the Battle of Crécy in 1346 and the Battle of Calais in 1347. These victories gave the English control over large parts of northern France and established them as a major power in Europe. However, the French regrouped and launched a counterattack, which culminated in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. This battle saw the capture of John II of France, who was taken prisoner by the English and held for ransom.</p><p>The war continued for many years, with both sides suffering significant losses. The English monarchy was weakened by the Black Death, which had ravaged Europe in the 1340s and had a devastating impact on the English population. The French, on the other hand, were able to recover more quickly from the plague and continued to fight on, ultimately emerging victorious.</p><p>One of the key turning points of the war came in 1429, when Joan of Arc, a young French heroine, led a successful campaign to retake the city of Orléans, which had been under siege by the English for several years. This victory gave a much-needed boost to the French morale and helped to turn the tide of the war in their favor.</p><p>The war finally came to an end in 1453, when the French captured the city of Castillon, which was the last English stronghold in southern France. The treaty that ended the war established France as the dominant power in Europe, and marked the beginning of a period of French dominance that would last for many centuries.</p><p>Throughout the Hundred Years&rsquo; War, both England and France suffered significant losses, including the loss of thousands of soldiers and civilians. The war also had a profound impact on the culture and society of both nations, with many poets, writers, and artists drawing inspiration from the conflict.</p><p>In conclusion, the Hundred Years&rsquo; War was a pivotal moment in European history, a prolonged conflict between England and France that lasted for nearly a century. The war was a struggle for supremacy between the two nations, with each side seeking to dominate the other and establish its own hegemony over Europe. Despite many setbacks and challenges, the French ultimately emerged victorious, and the war marked the beginning of a period of French dominance that would last for many centuries.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://www.googlexy.com/categories/history/>History</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.googlexy.com/the-hundred-years-war-england-vs.-france/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Hundred Years' War: England vs. France</span>
