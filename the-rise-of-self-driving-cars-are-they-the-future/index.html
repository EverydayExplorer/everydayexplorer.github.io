These vehicles rely on a combination of technologies, including machine learning algorithms, LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), radar, and computer vision, to perceive their surroundings and make real-time decisions.</p><h3 id=levels-of-autonomy>Levels of Autonomy</h3><p>The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) categorizes the levels of vehicle automation from Level 0 (no automation) to Level 5 (full automation). Understanding these levels helps clarify the current state of self-driving technology:</p><ul><li><strong>Level 0:</strong> No automation. The human driver is responsible for all driving tasks.</li><li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Driver assistance. The vehicle can assist with steering or acceleration, but the driver must remain engaged.</li><li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Partial automation. The vehicle can control steering and acceleration simultaneously under certain conditions, but the driver must maintain oversight.</li><li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Conditional automation. The vehicle can perform all driving tasks in specific scenarios, but a human driver must be ready to take over when requested.</li><li><strong>Level 4:</strong> High automation. The vehicle can handle all driving tasks in most environments without human intervention but may require human control in certain situations.</li><li><strong>Level 5:</strong> Full automation. The vehicle can operate without any human input in all conditions and environments.</li></ul><p>As of now, most commercially available self-driving features fall within Levels 1 and 2, with companies like Tesla and Waymo leading the charge toward higher levels of automation.</p><h2 id=the-technological-landscape>The Technological Landscape</h2><p>The rise of self-driving cars is fueled by rapid advancements in several key technologies:</p><h3 id=1-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning>1.
