But did you know that your zodiac sign can influence the type of exercise that is best suited for you? Whether you&rsquo;re an energetic Aries or a practical Virgo, aligning your fitness routine with your astrological sign can help you achieve better results and stay motivated.</p><p>Aries (March 21 - April 19): As a fiery and energetic sign, Aries individuals thrive on high-intensity workouts that challenge both their physical and mental strength.
