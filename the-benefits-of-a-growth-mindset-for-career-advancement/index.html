As organizations continue to seek out innovative thinkers and problem solvers, individuals with a growth mindset are well-positioned to drive positive change and contribute to the advancement of their companies.</p><h2 id=collaboration-and-teamwork>Collaboration and Teamwork</h2><p>Individuals with a growth mindset are open to feedback, collaboration, and constructive criticism.
