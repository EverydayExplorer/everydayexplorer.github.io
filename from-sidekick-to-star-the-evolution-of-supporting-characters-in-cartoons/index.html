At first, supporting characters were nothing more than background noise, just another character to fill the scene. But as time went on, they began to evolve into full-fledged personalities that could stand on their own two feet. In this blog, we’ll look at the evolution of supporting characters in cartoons and how they went from being mere sidekicks to stars in their own right.</p><p>The Beginning of Cartoons</p><p>The first cartoons are often considered to be silent era cartoons, such as the legendary duo of Tom and Jerry. During these early years, supporting characters had little to no personality. They were there to provide a little comic relief and make the main character look better. They didn’t have any aspirations or desires of their own—their only goal was to help the main character achieve his goal. The best examples of these early sidekicks were Jerry’s mouse friends, who were meant to add a little extra humor to the scenes.</p><p>The Golden Age of Cartoons</p><p>In the 1940s, cartoonists really began to give supporting characters a more distinct personality. With the emergence of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig, supporting characters went from being mere background characters to having their own story arcs and personality quirks. The brilliant cartoonists who created these timeless characters were able to turn them into fully fleshed out individuals by giving them unique traits and motivations.</p><p>One of the best examples of how supporting characters evolved during this time was how Daffy Duck evolved. When Daffy first appeared, he was just another zany sidekick meant to make Bugs Bunny look good. But after a few short films, he began to develop his own personality, with his humorous boasts and larger-than-life personality. He became a character that people could relate to, and he quickly became one of the most popular cartoon characters of all time.</p><p>The Modern Era</p><p>In the modern era of cartoons, supporting characters have continued to evolve. No longer are they just mere sidekicks meant to make the main character look good. Now, entire shows are built around supporting characters that have their own storylines and personalities. For example, in the hit show The Simpsons, the entire cast of supporting characters has become as important as the main characters.</p><p>One of the most interesting ways that supporting characters have evolved in the modern era is through their relationships with the main characters. In shows like SpongeBob SquarePants, supporting characters like Patrick Star and Squidward Tentacles are shown to have complex relationships with SpongeBob. They have their own personalities and desires, and interact with the main character in unique ways.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In conclusion, supporting characters in cartoons have come a long way over the last century. They started out as mere background characters to provide a little comic relief, but they have evolved into fully fleshed out individuals with their own stories and motivations. Today, no longer are they just sidekicks meant to help the main character achieve their goal. They have become stars in their own right, and provide a unique perspective on the world of cartoons. By giving supporting characters their own personalities and motivations, cartoonists have been able to create some of the most memorable and iconic characters in the history of animation.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://www.googlexy.com/categories/cartoons/>Cartoons</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.googlexy.com/from-sidekick-to-hero-the-evolution-of-secondary-cartoon-characters/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>From Sidekick to Hero: The Evolution of Secondary Cartoon Characters</span>
