The Greeks believed that dreams held prophetic power, offering glimpses into the future or providing guidance in times of need. The interpretation of these dreams, known as Oneiromancy, was considered an important skill possessed by individuals known as Oneiromancers.</p><p>In Norse mythology, dreams were seen as a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms. Odin, the chief god in Norse mythology, was known to send his ravens, Huginn and Muninn, to collect information from the human world during the day. At night, he would consult with the Norns, the goddesses of fate, who would weave the events of the future. The dreams that humans experienced were seen as glimpses into the tapestry of fate, providing insight into the path that lay ahead.</p><p>In Egyptian mythology, dreams were believed to be the result of the soul leaving the body to travel to the realm of the gods.

Similarly, in Indian mythology, dreams are believed to be influenced by the cosmic energies and can offer guidance and prophetic insights.</p><p>One of the most renowned dream interpreters in history is the legendary Greek philosopher, Aristotle.
