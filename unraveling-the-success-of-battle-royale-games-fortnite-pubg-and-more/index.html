The unpredictable nature of battle royale matches, where anything can happen, adds an element of excitement and suspense that sets them apart from traditional multiplayer games.</p><p>**Accessibility and Wide Reach**</p><p>Fortnite and PUBG have enjoyed unprecedented success due to their accessibility and wide reach. Both games are available on multiple platforms, including PC, consoles, and mobile devices. This cross-platform functionality allows players to connect with friends and compete against others, regardless of the device they are using.

By offering the base game for free, Fortnite removed the barrier to entry and allowed a massive influx of players. The microtransaction system, where players can purchase cosmetic items and battle passes, allows the game to sustain its development and provide ongoing support. This business model has proven to be highly profitable and has since been emulated by other successful battle royale games.</p><p>**Streaming and Esports**</p><p>The rise of battle royale games has also been fueled by the popularity of streaming platforms like Twitch and the growth of esports. Online streaming has allowed gamers to showcase their gameplay skills and interact with a global audience, contributing to the viral growth of games like Fortnite and PUBG. The competitive nature of battle royale games has also made them an ideal fit for esports, with numerous tournaments and leagues springing up around these games.
