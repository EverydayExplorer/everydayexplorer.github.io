In this blog post, we will delve into the rich history of comic books, explore iconic characters, and discuss their enduring popularity.</p><h2 id=a-brief-history-of-comic-books>A Brief History of Comic Books</h2><p>Comic books as we know them today have a fascinating history that dates back to the late 19th century. Before the advent of comic books, sequential art appeared in newspapers and magazines, usually in the form of political cartoons or humorous strips. It wasn&rsquo;t until the 1930s that the first comic book, &lsquo;Famous Funnies,&rsquo; was published and sold in bookshops.</p><p>However, it was the introduction of Superman in Action Comics #1 in 1938 that truly revolutionized the industry and marked the beginning of the Golden Age of comics. Superman&rsquo;s incredible powers and moral code struck a chord with readers and paved the way for countless other superhero characters.</p><p>The Silver Age of comics, which began in the late 1950s, brought another wave of iconic characters, including Marvel&rsquo;s Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men. These flawed and relatable characters added a new dimension to the genre, and their popularity skyrocketed.</p><p>In recent years, comic books have become more diverse and inclusive, with characters from different backgrounds and cultures gaining prominence. The vibrant and evolving nature of the medium ensures that there is always something new and exciting for readers to discover.</p><h2 id=iconic-comic-book-characters>Iconic Comic Book Characters</h2><p>Comic books are known for their larger-than-life characters, many of whom have become cultural icons.
