From uplifting speeches and interviews with activists, to personal confessionals and lifestyle transformations, Oprah&rsquo;s presence has been an influence for a better life for millions of people around the world. One of Oprah&rsquo;s most enduring legacies is The Oprah Winfrey Book Club, which debuted in 1996 and ran until 2011. In this blog post, we will explore The Oprah Effect on the world of books, and discuss some of the most popular books that made it to her book club.</p><p>Throughout its 15-year duration, The Oprah Winfrey Book Club became a cultural phenomenon that turned obscure titles into bestsellers overnight. Oprah&rsquo;s ability to connect with her audience and endorse a piece of literature was unparalleled. Her influence on sales was so great that publishers would even print a special edition with the Oprah Book Club logo on the cover. But what was it about the books Oprah picked that resonated so deeply with her viewers?</p><p>Perhaps the most obvious reason is Oprah&rsquo;s ability to relate to others. She has always been open about her personal struggles - her weight, abuse, depression, and more. This relatability made her viewers feel that she understood their struggles. When she picked a book, her audience felt that it was a recommendation from a friend who truly understood their experiences.</p><p>Another reason the books Oprah chose were so effective was that they tackled universal themes and emotions. Many of the books she picked were about redemption, forgiveness, and hope. These themes are universally relevant, and resonate with readers from all walks of life.</p><p>Some of the most popular books that Oprah Winfrey picked for her book club include &lsquo;The Color Purple&rsquo; by Alice Walker, &lsquo;Song of Solomon&rsquo; by Toni Morrison, &lsquo;A New Earth&rsquo; by Eckhart Tolle, &lsquo;The Pillars of the Earth&rsquo; by Ken Follett, and &lsquo;The Poisonwood Bible&rsquo; by Barbara Kingsolver.</p><p>&lsquo;The Color Purple&rsquo; is an iconic novel about the struggles African American women faced in the early 20th century. Through the life of Celie, the novel explores themes of abuse, racism, and sexism. The book became a bestseller after Oprah chose it for her book club. It was later adapted into a critically acclaimed film directed by Steven Spielberg.</p><p>&lsquo;Song of Solomon&rsquo; by Toni Morrison explores the life of Macon &lsquo;Milkman&rsquo; Dead, an African American man grappling with his identity within the context of his family&rsquo;s history. The novel won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1977 and was chosen by Oprah in 1996.</p><p>&lsquo;A New Earth&rsquo; by Eckhart Tolle became a sensation when Oprah picked it for her book club in 2008. The book offers a spiritual approach to personal growth, and encourages readers to live in the present moment. Oprah herself has become a devoted follower of Tolle&rsquo;s teachings.</p><p>&lsquo;The Poisonwood Bible&rsquo; by Barbara Kingsolver tells the story of a family that moves from Georgia to the Congo in the late 1950s. Through their journey, the novel explores themes of cultural imperialism, identity, and the human cost of politics. The book was a commercial and critical success, and Oprah picked it for her book club in 1998.</p><p>&lsquo;The Pillars of the Earth&rsquo; by Ken Follett is a historical novel set in 12th-century England. The book tells the story of a stonemason named Tom Builder, who dreams of building a grand cathedral in the fictional town of Kingsbridge. The novel became an international bestseller after Oprah picked it for her book club in 2007.</p><p>All in all, the Oprah Winfrey Book Club revolutionized the publishing industry and created a new standard for book endorsements. Oprah&rsquo;s personal connection to her audience, her authenticity, and her ability to identify with themes that resonate with readers are what made her book club such a success. The books she picked for her club addressed important themes like racism, sexism, and spirituality - themes that continue to be relevant and universally resonant.</p><p>While The Oprah Winfrey Show may no longer be on the air, her legacy of empowering others through books lives on. Books will continue to be a source of comfort, inspiration, and personal growth for years to come, and Oprah&rsquo;s book club remains an important part of that journey.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://www.googlexy.com/categories/books/>Books</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.googlexy.com/the-mystery-of-book-censorship-from-controversial-to-banned/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Mystery of Book Censorship: From Controversial to Banned</span>
