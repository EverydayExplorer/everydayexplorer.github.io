Some commonly used animals include dogs, cats, horses, and even dolphins. Each animal brings its own unique qualities and benefits to the therapy process.</p><p>Dogs are known for their loyalty and ability to provide comfort. They can be particularly effective in helping individuals with anxiety and trauma-related disorders.</p><p>Cats, with their calming presence and independent nature, can be beneficial for individuals who prefer a quieter and more relaxed therapy environment.</p><p>Horses, through activities such as equine-assisted therapy, can help individuals develop trust, improve communication skills, and gain a deeper understanding of their own emotions.</p><p>Dolphins, with their playful and interactive nature, can be used in therapy sessions to promote creativity, joy, and a sense of connection.</p><h2 id=finding-an-animal-assisted-therapy-program>Finding an Animal-Assisted Therapy Program</h2><p>If you are interested in exploring animal-assisted therapy for emotional healing, it is important to find a reputable and qualified program.
