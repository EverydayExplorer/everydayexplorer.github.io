Bobbleheads of popular cartoon characters like The Simpsons and Batman have been incredibly popular over the years.</p><p>Statues are also a popular collectible that has gained popularity over the past few years. They are an expensive collectible, and collectors love their attention to detail. Statues are usually made of expensive materials such as bronze, and they are typically only produced in limited quantities. Statues of popular cartoon characters like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and The Powerpuff Girls have been extremely popular among collectors.</p><p>While collectibles have always been a popular aspect of Cartoon Merchandise, new and exciting merchandise has come up in recent years. Clothing is a newer development in the world of Cartoon Merchandise, and it has taken the industry by storm. Clothing ranges from t-shirts, hoodies, socks, and much more.
