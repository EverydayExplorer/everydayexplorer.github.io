They are considered to be the punishers of evil deeds and the enforcers of justice. Oni are said to appear during nights of the Setsubun festival, when people throw roasted beans to drive away evil spirits.</p><p>Despite their menacing appearance, Oni are not always malevolent beings. In some stories, they are portrayed as protectors of Buddhist temples and faithful guardians. However, in most tales, they are seen as terrifying entities that represent the consequences of wicked actions.</p><p><strong>Tengu</strong></p><p>Tengu are another fascinating creature in Japanese folklore, often depicted as bird-like beings with human-like features. They are known for their long, beak-like noses and feathered wings. Tengu are believed to inhabit the mountains and forests of Japan, where they live as reclusive beings.</p><p>In Japanese folklore, Tengu are known for their exceptional martial arts skills and their ability to control the wind. They are often depicted as skilled swordsmen, holding fans that can summon strong winds and deflect arrows. Tengu are known to be mischievous and enjoy playing tricks on humans.</p><p>Tengu are also associated with wisdom and spiritual enlightenment. In Buddhism, they are considered to be protectors of the Dharma and are often portrayed as wise sages. Tengu are revered in some Japanese martial arts schools as symbols of discipline and perseverance.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The mythological beings of Kitsune, Oni, and Tengu play a significant role in Japanese folklore. These creatures represent the complex and diverse beliefs of the Japanese people, showcasing their fascination with the supernatural and their respect for the natural world.</p><p>The legends surrounding Kitsune, Oni, and Tengu have been passed down for generations, enriching the cultural heritage of Japan.
