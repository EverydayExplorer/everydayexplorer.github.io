From ancient civilizations to modern times, people have sought ways to understand the stars and derive meaning from their positions in the sky. One of the most important components of astrology is the concept of astrological houses. These houses provide a framework for interpreting the influences of the planets and other celestial bodies on an individual&rsquo;s life.</p><p>But what exactly are astrological houses? Imagine the sky divided into twelve equal slices, each one representing a different area of life. These divisions, known as houses, establish the stage on which the planets and other celestial bodies perform their unique cosmic dance. By analyzing the planets&rsquo; placement in these houses, astrologers can glean insights into various aspects of a person&rsquo;s life, including their personality traits, relationships, and career path.</p><p>Each astrological house is associated with a different area of life, providing us with a roadmap for understanding the influence of the heavens.
