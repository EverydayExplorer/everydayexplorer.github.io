Turmeric, with its vibrant golden hue, has its roots in Southeast Asia, while sumac, a tangy and citrusy spice, is derived from the dried fruits of a shrub native to the Middle East.</p><h2 id=unveiling-the-unique-characteristics-of-exotic-spices>Unveiling the Unique Characteristics of Exotic Spices</h2><p>Each exotic spice possesses unique characteristics that contribute to its distinctive flavor profile.
