Hirsi&rsquo;s passion for climate activism comes from her concern for her future and the futures of her peers.</p><p>As a daughter of Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born American politician, she experienced first hand the challenges that marginalized communities face when it comes to environmental justice. She believes that young people have a responsibility to speak out on environmental issues.</p><p>Vanessa Nakate</p><p>Vanessa Nakate is a 23-year-old from Uganda who is leading the fight against climate change in Africa.

Zero Hour is a youth-led organization that is working to center the voices of young people in the fight for climate action.</p><p>Margolin has been involved in organizing protests and lobbying lawmakers, and she has also written a book, &lsquo;Youth to Power: Your Voice and How to Use It,&rsquo; which encourages young people to get involved in activism and make their voices heard.</p><p>These are just a few of the inspiring young people who are leading the fight against climate change.
