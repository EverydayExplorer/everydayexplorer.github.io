This process allows individuals to gain a deeper understanding of their emotions and reduce feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression.</p><h3 id=2-self-discovery-and-self-awareness>2. Self-Discovery and Self-Awareness</h3><p>Creating art in a therapeutic setting can help individuals gain insights into their own thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors.
