Persons with intellectual disabilities or ID constitute one of the largest and most marginalized groups that are often deprived of several basic human rights. Their needs and potential are often overlooked or subordinated, leading to discriminatory practices resulting in low quality of life. Therefore, it is essential to provide them an environment where they have access to their rights and live a better quality of life.</p><p>One of the primary human rights of individuals with intellectual disabilities is the right to life. This right is guaranteed by Article 6 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that “everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.” In addition, people with ID are entitled to the right to medical treatment, including nutrition and water, shelter and accommodation, and education. Most importantly, they have the right to be treated with respect and dignity, without any form of discrimination.</p><p>Persons with intellectual disabilities have unique challenges in terms of access to education and employment opportunities. They may experience difficulties in acquiring the necessary skills and training, which are essential to gain meaningful employment. Therefore, these individuals have the right to a fair and equal education, as well as employment opportunities that will enable them to live independently and contribute to the economy. Additionally, they have the right to participate in activities, which are beneficial to their overall development and quality of life, such as sports, arts and culture.</p><p>Apart from these, people with ID have the right to be free from neglect and abuse, including physical, sexual, verbal, psychological and emotional abuse. They have the right to receive care and support in a safe and secure environment. Therefore, it is essential to take necessary steps to prevent and address any form of abuse, neglect or mistreatment.</p><p>Moreover, individuals with intellectual disabilities often face negative attitudes, stereotypes and prejudices within their communities. They have the right to live with dignity and to be accepted in society. Therefore, it is vital to promote social inclusion, acceptance, and understanding through education, awareness and advocacy. Community-based initiatives, such as support groups, inclusive sports programs and other social services can help individuals with ID to feel more included and valued within their communities.</p><p>Finally, it is crucial to recognize the rights of persons with intellectual disabilities to participate in decision-making processes that will affect their lives. They have the right to express their opinions and make choices, according to their wishes and preferences. Therefore, it is essential to provide them with the necessary support and assistance to exercise their rights and make informed decisions based on their abilities and interests.</p><p>In conclusion, individuals with intellectual disabilities are entitled to the basic human rights that are essential for human dignity, freedom and equality. These individuals have the right to life, medical treatment, education, employment, and social inclusion. They have a right to be free from abuse, neglect, and discrimination. Finally, they have the right to participate in decision-making processes that will impact their lives. It is essential to provide these individuals with the necessary support and assistance to enable them to exercise their rights for a better, more fulfilling quality of life.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://www.googlexy.com/categories/human-rights-and-social-justice/>Human Rights and Social Justice</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.googlexy.com/the-rights-of-persons-with-intellectual-disabilities-inclusive-education/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Rights of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities: Inclusive Education</span>
