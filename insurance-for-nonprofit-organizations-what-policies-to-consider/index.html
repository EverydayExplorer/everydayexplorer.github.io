Special event insurance provides coverage for liability risks associated with these events, including bodily injury, property damage, and alcohol-related incidents. This type of insurance ensures that the organization is protected against unforeseen liabilities and can host successful events without financial concerns.</p></li></ol><p>In conclusion, insurance plays a critical role in protecting nonprofit organizations from various risks and liabilities. By securing the right insurance policies, nonprofits can safeguard their assets, employees, volunteers, and mission against unforeseen events.
