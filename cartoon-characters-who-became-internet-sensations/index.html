Pepe the Frog</h2><p>Initially created by artist Matt Furie as a laid-back, fun-loving frog in his comic series &lsquo;Boy&rsquo;s Club,&rsquo; Pepe the Frog took a dark turn when it was co-opted by some elements of the alt-right as a symbol of hate. Despite these negative connotations, Pepe became a viral sensation, with internet users remixing and reinterpreting the character in countless ways. This shows the power of the internet to take something innocent and transform it into something entirely different.</p><h2 id=3-pikachu>3.
