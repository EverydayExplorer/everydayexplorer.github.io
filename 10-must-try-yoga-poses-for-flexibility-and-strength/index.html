One of the main reasons people are drawn to yoga is to increase flexibility and strength. Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned yogi, there are certain poses that you must try in order to achieve optimal flexibility and strength. In this blog post, we will explore 10 must-try yoga poses that will help you improve both your flexibility and strength.</p><p>1. Downward Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)<br>This pose is a staple in most yoga classes and is great for increasing flexibility in the hamstrings, calves, and shoulders. It also helps to strengthen the arms, shoulders, and core muscles. To perform this pose, start on your hands and knees, with your hands slightly in front of your shoulders. Push into your hands, lift your hips up towards the ceiling, and straighten your legs. Your body should resemble an inverted &lsquo;V&rsquo;. Hold this pose for 5-10 breaths, focusing on lengthening your spine and pressing your heels towards the ground.</p><p>2. Warrior I (Virabhadrasana I)<br>This pose not only improves flexibility in the hips and shoulders but also strengthens the legs, ankles, and core muscles. Start in a standing position, step your left foot back, and turn it out to a 45-degree angle. Bend your right knee, keeping it directly over your ankle, and raise your arms up towards the ceiling. Hold this pose for 5-10 breaths, focusing on sinking deeper into the lunge and lifting through the chest.</p><p>3. Bridge Pose (Setu Bandha Sarvangasana)<br>Bridge pose is a great pose for opening up the chest, shoulders, and hips, while also strengthening the legs, glutes, and core muscles. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet hip-width apart. Press into your feet, lifting your hips up towards the ceiling. Interlace your fingers underneath you and roll your shoulders onto your back. Hold this pose for 5-10 breaths, focusing on lifting your hips as high as you can and opening up through the chest.</p><p>4. Triangle Pose (Trikonasana)<br>This pose is excellent for increasing flexibility in the hips and hamstrings and strengthening the legs, core, and back muscles. Start in a standing position, step your left foot back, and turn it out to a 90-degree angle. Extend your arms out to the sides and reach forward with your right hand, placing it on your shin, ankle, or the floor. Extend your left arm up towards the ceiling, creating a straight line from your left fingers to your left heel. Hold this pose for 5-10 breaths on each side, focusing on lengthening through your spine and opening up through the chest.</p><p>5. Chair Pose (Utkatasana)<br>This pose is excellent for strengthening the legs, glutes, and core muscles, while also improving flexibility in the shoulders and chest. Start in a standing position and bring your feet hip-width apart. Bend your knees, as if you are sitting back into an imaginary chair, and raise your arms up towards the ceiling. Hold this pose for 5-10 breaths, focusing on sinking deeper into the squat and lifting through the chest.</p><p>6. Plank Pose (Phalakasana)<br>Plank pose is a powerful pose for strengthening the arms, shoulders, core, and leg muscles. Start in a push-up position, with your hands directly under your shoulders and your legs extended behind you. Engage your core and hold this pose for 5-10 breaths, focusing on keeping your body in a straight line from your head to your heels.</p><p>7. Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana)<br>Cobra pose is an ideal pose for opening up the chest and shoulders, while also strengthening the spine and core muscles. Lie on your stomach, with your legs extended behind you and your hands under your shoulders. Press into your hands, lifting your chest off the ground and arching your back. Hold this pose for 5-10 breaths, focusing on lengthening through your spine and opening up through the chest.</p><p>8. Tree Pose (Vrksasana)<br>Tree pose is a wonderful pose for improving balance and strengthening the legs, while also opening up the hips and shoulders. Start in a standing position, shift your weight onto your left foot, and bring your right foot to rest on the inside of your left leg. Find a focal point to gaze at and bring your hands to prayer position at your heart. Hold this pose for 5-10 breaths on each side, focusing on finding balance and grounding through your standing leg.</p><p>9. Pigeon Pose (Eka Pada Rajakapotasana)<br>Pigeon pose is a deep hip opener that also helps to stretch the groins and glutes. Start in a downward facing dog position and bring your right knee forward, placing it behind your right wrist. Extend your left leg behind you and rest your hips on the ground. Fold forward, lengthening your torso over your right leg. Hold this pose for 5-10 breaths, focusing on releasing any tension in your hips and surrendering to the pose.</p><p>10. Child&rsquo;s Pose (Balasana)<br>Child&rsquo;s pose is a relaxing pose that helps to release tension in the back, neck, and shoulders, while also stretching the hips and ankles. Start kneeling on the ground, bringing your big toes together and sitting back onto your heels. Fold forward, resting your forehead on the ground and extending your arms out in front of you. Hold this pose for as long as you like, allowing yourself to surrender and relax.</p><p>Incorporating these 10 must-try yoga poses into your practice will not only increase your flexibility and strength but also enhance your overall well-being.
