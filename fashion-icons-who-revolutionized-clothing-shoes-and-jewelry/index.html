Throughout history, fashion has changed to different degrees, and it has been influenced by a wide range of people. Fashion icons have emerged to revolutionize the clothing, shoes, and jewelry industry by introducing new styles, breaking norms, and challenging what was considered fashionable. In this blog post, we will delve into some of the most influential fashion icons who have made significant contributions to the fashion world.</p><p>1. Coco Chanel<br>Coco Chanel is undoubtedly one of the most important fashion icons of the 20th century. Born in 1883, in Saumur, France, she introduced the concept of casual chic into the fashion industry. Chanel was known for her simple yet elegant designs that featured clean lines and were devoid of the ornate styles that were popular during her time. She revolutionized women&rsquo;s clothing by introducing comfortable, practical, and stylish outfits like the little black dress, twinset, and tailored jacket, which were previously associated with men&rsquo;s clothing. Chanel also popularized costume jewelry, such as pearls, and introduced the concept of mixing high-end fashion with cheaper costume jewelry.</p><p>2. Audrey Hepburn<br>Audrey Hepburn is often cited as the epitome of classic style and elegance. Her influence on fashion was undeniable, from her character in &lsquo;Breakfast at Tiffany&rsquo;s&rsquo; wearing that little black dress and pearls to her unique accessories like the oversized sunglasses she wore in &lsquo;Roman Holiday.&rsquo; Hepburn embodied simplicity and grace, and fashion designers of that time took note, with many of them replicating her classic style.</p><p>3. Princess Diana<br>Princess Diana was a trendsetter both on and off the screen. She became known for her iconic style, which featured bold patterns, bright colors, and bold accessories. One of her most popular fashion statements was her wedding dress, which was designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel. Her fashion choices were so influential that many designers began creating items inspired by her, such as the &lsquo;Lady Di&rsquo; bag.</p><p>4. Michael Jackson<br>Michael Jackson was not only a legendary musician but also a fashion icon. He introduced bold and striking styles that were unique and unlike anything that had been seen before. Michael Jackson&rsquo;s style included military-inspired jackets, extravagant sequined and embellished outfits, and dramatic footwear, such as his iconic glittery socks and loafers.</p><p>5. Sarah Jessica Parker<br>Sarah Jessica Parker catapulted to fame for her role as Carrie Bradshaw in &lsquo;Sex and the City.&rsquo; Her character&rsquo;s love affair with fashion made her a virtual fashion icon, introducing many fashionable concepts like the Manolo Blahnik shoes, tutu skirts, and oversized flower accessories. Sarah Jessica Parker&rsquo;s experiential attitude towards fashion helped her redefine the relationship between celebrities and fashion.</p><p>In conclusion, fashion icons have played a vital role in shaping the fashion industry as we know it today. Their contributions and influence have extended beyond the runway and have touched every aspect of society. These icons have forever changed the way we view clothing, shoes, and jewelry and have often challenged the status quo. They have given us the freedom to express ourselves through fashion and have proven that fashion is not merely a statement of style, but also a reflection of the times and society.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://www.googlexy.com/categories/clothing-shoes-and-jewelry/>Clothing Shoes and Jewelry</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.googlexy.com/fashion-icons-through-the-decades-from-audrey-to-rihanna/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Fashion Icons Through the Decades: From Audrey to Rihanna</span>
