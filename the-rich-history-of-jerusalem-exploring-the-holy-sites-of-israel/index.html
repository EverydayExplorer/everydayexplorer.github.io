This ancient city has been the center of three major religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - and has a rich history that spans over 5,000 years. From the earliest civilizations to the present day, Jerusalem has been a city of great significance, attracting pilgrims, scholars, and travelers from all over the world.</p><h2 id=早期歷史>早期歷史</h2><p>The earliest known human settlement in Jerusalem dates back to the 4th millennium BCE, during the Bronze Age. The city was known as &ldquo;Urusalim&rdquo; and was a small Jebusite village. In the 10th century BCE, King David conquered the city and made it the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel. After David&rsquo;s death, his son Solomon built the First Temple, which became a center of Jewish worship and learning.</p><h2 id=第二聖殿時期>第二聖殿時期</h2><p>After the destruction of the First Temple by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, the Jews returned to Jerusalem and rebuilt the Second Temple, which was completed in 515 BCE. This period saw a significant increase in Jewish learning and culture, with the establishment of the Talmudic academies and the development of Jewish law and tradition.</p><h2 id=基督教的來臨>基督教的來臨</h2><p>In the 1st century CE, Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem and died in Jerusalem. The city became a center of Christian pilgrimage, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built over the site of Jesus&rsquo; crucifixion and burial. The city was also the location of the Last Supper, which is commemorated by the Church of the Agony in the Garden.</p><h2 id=伊斯蘭的來臨>伊斯蘭的來臨</h2><p>In the 7th century CE, Jerusalem was conquered by the Arabs, who brought Islam to the city. The Dome of the Rock was built on the Temple Mount, and the city became a center of Islamic learning and culture. The city was also the location of the Crusades, which saw the city change hands several times between Christian and Muslim forces.</p><h2 id=現代歷史>現代歷史</h2><p>In the 20th century, Jerusalem became a hotbed of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, with the city being divided between Israel and Jordan. In 1967, Israel captured the eastern part of the city, which had been under Jordanian control since 1948. Today, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, although its status is still disputed by the international community.</p><h2 id=聖地和景點>聖地和景點</h2><p>Despite the complex and often turbulent history of Jerusalem, the city is home to many important holy sites and landmarks. The Western Wall, also known as the Wailing Wall, is the last remnant of the Second Temple and a sacred place for Jews. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is one of the most important Christian pilgrimage sites, and the Dome of the Rock is a symbol of Islamic culture and learning.</p><p>The city is also home to many museums, galleries, and cultural institutions, including the Israel Museum, the Rockefeller Museum, and the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra. The city&rsquo;s Old City is a maze of narrow streets and alleys, filled with shops, restaurants, and historic landmarks like the Tower of David and the Church of St. Anne.</p><h2 id=探索聖地>探索聖地</h2><p>For those who are interested in exploring the rich history and culture of Jerusalem, there are many ways to do so.
