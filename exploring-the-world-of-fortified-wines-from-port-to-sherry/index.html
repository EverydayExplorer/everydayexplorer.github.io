These unique and flavorful wines are often enjoyed as a dessert or after-dinner drink, and they offer a complexity that is unmatched by other wine varieties. In this blog, we will explore the world of fortified wines, with a focus on two popular varieties: port and sherry.</p><p>Port, often referred to as &rsquo;the wine of kings and the king of wines,&rsquo; is a Portuguese fortified wine that hails from the Douro Valley. It has been produced for over three centuries and is considered one of the finest dessert wines in the world. The process of making port involves adding grape spirit, or brandy, to the partially fermented grape juice. This halts the fermentation process and leaves behind residual sugar, resulting in a sweet and rich wine.</p><p>There are several different styles of port, each with its own unique characteristics. Ruby port, for example, is young and vibrant, with flavors of dark fruit and berries. Tawny port, on the other hand, is aged in wood barrels, resulting in a more mellow and nutty flavor profile. Vintage port is made from the best grapes of a single vintage year and is known for its intense flavors and potential for aging.</p><p>Sherry, another popular fortified wine, comes from the Andalusian region of Spain. It is made from white wine grapes, primarily Palomino, and is fortified with grape spirit. Sherry is unique in that it undergoes a special aging process called the solera system. This involves blending wines from different vintages and aging them in a progression of barrels, resulting in a complex and layered flavor profile.</p><p>One of the key characteristics of sherry is its dryness, although there are also sweeter styles available. Fino and Manzanilla are the driest types of sherry, with a light and saline flavor. Amontillado, Oloroso, and Palo Cortado are all richer and nuttier in style, with Oloroso being the darkest and most full-bodied. Finally, there are the sweet styles of sherry, such as Pedro Ximénez and Cream, which offer a luscious sweetness and intense flavors of raisins and figs.</p><p>Both port and sherry pair exceptionally well with a wide range of foods. Port is often enjoyed with rich, chocolate-based desserts, cheeses, and nuts. It is also a classic accompaniment to a cheese board, as its sweetness complements the savory flavors of the cheese. Sherry, on the other hand, is incredibly versatile and can be enjoyed with anything from seafood to spicy dishes. Fino and Manzanilla sherries are perfect with tapas and seafood dishes, while Oloroso and Pedro Ximénez sherries pair beautifully with grilled meats and desserts.</p><p>In addition to being delicious, fortified wines have several health benefits. They are a rich source of antioxidants, which can help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. Port, in particular, has been found to have high levels of antioxidants, including resveratrol, which has been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.</p><p>When it comes to choosing a bottle of fortified wine, it is important to consider the age and quality. Vintage ports, for example, are known for their exceptional aging potential and can be enjoyed for decades. However, they also come with a higher price tag. Non-vintage ports, on the other hand, are a more affordable option and can still offer great flavor and complexity.</p><p>Sherry is often sold non-vintage, with the average bottle being a blend of wines from different years. This means that you can enjoy a consistent flavor profile year after year. However, there are also vintage sherries available, which offer a unique expression of a specific year&rsquo;s harvest.</p><p>In conclusion, the world of fortified wines is a fascinating one, filled with history, tradition, and incredible flavors. Whether you prefer the sweetness of port or the complex dryness of sherry, there is a fortified wine out there to suit every palate. So the next time you&rsquo;re looking to explore the world of wine, be sure to give these unique and flavorful options a try.
