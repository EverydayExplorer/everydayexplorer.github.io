One powerful practice that has been used for centuries to access the spiritual realms is shamanic journeying. Through this ancient technique, individuals can delve into the depths of their own consciousness and the realms beyond to gain wisdom, healing, and a profound sense of spiritual connection.</p><h2 id=what-is-shamanic-journeying>What is Shamanic Journeying?</h2><p>Shamanic journeying is a method that allows practitioners to enter an altered state of consciousness in order to explore hidden realms and receive guidance from spirits, ancestors, and animal guides. This practice is rooted in the belief that everything in the universe is interconnected and that there is wisdom and guidance available to us from unseen realms.</p><p>Shamans, or spiritual practitioners, have long used journeying as a tool to connect with the spirit world and receive healing and guidance. Today, many people are rediscovering this practice as a way to access their inner wisdom and tap into the collective consciousness.</p><h2 id=how-does-shamanic-journeying-work>How Does Shamanic Journeying Work?</h2><p>Shamanic journeying typically involves lying down in a comfortable position, closing one&rsquo;s eyes, and entering a relaxed state. It&rsquo;s important to create a safe and sacred space in which to embark on the journey. This can be done through the use of ritual tools, such as smudging with sage or lighting candles.</p><p>Once in this altered state, practitioners visualize themselves entering a portal, such as a cave or a tree, and descending into the underworld or ascending into the upper world. Within these realms, they can encounter various spirit beings, such as animal guides or ancestors, who can offer guidance, healing, and insights.</p><p>Shamanic journeying is a form of active imagination, where the mind is in a relaxed and receptive state. It allows individuals to explore their subconscious and receive information that may not be accessible in their everyday consciousness.</p><h2 id=benefits-of-shamanic-journeying>Benefits of Shamanic Journeying</h2><p>Shamanic journeying offers a wide range of benefits for those who practice it regularly.
