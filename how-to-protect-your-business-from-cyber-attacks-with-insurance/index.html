One effective strategy to mitigate the risks associated with cyber attacks is through the acquisition of cyber insurance. This post will delve into how cyber insurance works, the types of coverage available, and essential steps to protect your business from cyber threats.</p><h2 id=understanding-cyber-insurance>Understanding Cyber Insurance</h2><p>Cyber insurance is a type of insurance designed to help businesses mitigate the financial impact of cyber incidents.
