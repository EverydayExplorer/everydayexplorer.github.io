There are twelve zodiac signs, each representing a different period of the year and having specific characteristics associated with them.

These cultures believed that the movements of celestial bodies were linked to the lives and destinies of individuals.</p><p>The zodiac signs were developed based on the path that the sun takes across the sky throughout the year. Each sign corresponds to a specific period when the sun is in that particular constellation. For example, Aries represents the period from March 21 to April 19 when the sun is in the constellation of Aries.</p><h2 id=understanding-the-twelve-zodiac-signs>Understanding the Twelve Zodiac Signs</h2><p>Each zodiac sign has its own set of unique characteristics and traits.
