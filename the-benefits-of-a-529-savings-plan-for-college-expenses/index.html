You might start visualizing them graduating as a lawyer, doctor, engineer or becoming the next business tycoon. Whatever profession they may choose, there is no escaping the reality that higher education costs money - a lot of it. For most families, including those from the middle-class, paying for a college education is a major financial challenge. To cover the cost of tuition, books, room, and board – a 529 college savings plan is your best bet.</p><p>This savings plan is specifically designed to help families save and pay for the future educational expenses of their children. Although similar to a traditional savings account, it carries several benefits that make it a highly preferred option for families seeking to save for their children&rsquo;s college education.</p><p>Here are some benefits of a 529 savings plan:</p><p>1. Tax Benefits</p><p>One of the most significant benefits of a 529 savings plan is the tax benefits it offers. Earnings in the plan grow tax-deferred, and when funds are withdrawn to pay for qualified college expenses, it is tax-free. That means that as your investments grow, you receive some tax benefits, and that is a huge advantage, especially as you start contributing to the plan early.</p><p>Also, if you decide to open up a plan that is in your child&rsquo;s name, you will see much less effect on their Federal Student Aid eligibility. Traditional savings account interest counts as student income, whereas 529 savings plan withdrawals do not count as student income.</p><p>2. Flexibility</p><p>A 529 savings plan provides tremendous flexibility. You or your child can use the account for tuition, room and board at a qualifying public or private college in any US state or eligible foreign college. In addition to college, funds can be used for trade school, vocational school, and graduate school.</p><p>If, for any reason, a child decides that they do not need all the funds, the plan &ldquo;beneficiary&rdquo; can be changed to a qualified family member without penalty. The account owner can manage this account regardless of beneficiary&rsquo;s age, unlike an Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minor Act (UTMA) account, where the account automatically transfers to the child at 18 or 21 years old.</p><p>3. High Contribution Limits</p><p>The contribution limits for 529 savings plans are high, and the limits are set by the state. Although it varies from state to state, some states even offer tax benefits to residents based on contributions made to a 529 savings plan. The more money you save now, the more your money can grow, and the easier it will be to pay for college later on.</p><p>4. Low Maintenance Account</p><p>Once you have opened a 529 savings plan, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about annual contribution caps or visit the bank often. Contributions can be made monthly, quarterly, or yearly based on your preferences. The plan will continue to grow until you are ready to withdraw the funds. The 529 savings plan takes away the hassle of constant monitoring that comes with a traditional savings account.</p><p>5. Generous Gifting</p><p>529 savings plans are ideal for grandparents or other family members who want to contribute to a child&rsquo;s college savings. The plan&rsquo;s gifting limits are relatively generous, up to $15,000 per year per beneficiary. Combined with a spouse, the amount increases to $30,000 per year. Donors can also choose to pay five years’ worth of gifts upfront, up to $75,000, and spread it evenly over five years.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Paying for higher education has never been an easy task for most families. However, with a 529 college savings plan, you can secure a brighter future for your child. Not only does it provide tax-saving benefits, but it offers flexibility, high contribution limits, low maintenance, and a generous gifting program. If you are considering an education savings plan, the 529 savings plan should certainly be at the top of your list. Start planning for it as early as possible, delay can prove to be expensive down the road.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://www.googlexy.com/categories/personal-finance/>Personal Finance</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.googlexy.com/the-benefits-of-a-529-plan-saving-for-your-childs-education/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Benefits of a 529 Plan: Saving for Your Child's Education</span>
