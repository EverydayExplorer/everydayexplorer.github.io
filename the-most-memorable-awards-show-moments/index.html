In a bizarre and hilarious turn, Reid accepted the award while wearing a shark costume. The moment was not only memorable for its absurdity but also showcased the playful spirit of the awards show, reminding viewers that not every moment has to be serious or dramatic.</p><h2 id=lady-gagas-powerful-performance>Lady Gaga’s Powerful Performance</h2><p>During the 2016 Oscars, Lady Gaga delivered a haunting rendition of &ldquo;Til It Happens to You,&rdquo; a song addressing the issue of sexual assault on college campuses. The performance was both moving and impactful, especially as survivors joined her on stage. This moment transcended entertainment, sparking conversations about a pressing social issue and showcasing the power of music as a tool for change.
