These approaches offer greater control over the size, shape, and composition of the resulting nanomaterials. Common bottom-up techniques include:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD):</strong> CVD is a widely used technique for synthesizing thin films and nanostructures. In this process, gaseous precursors react on a substrate to form a solid material. CVD is particularly valuable in producing high-quality graphene and carbon nanotubes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sol-Gel Process:</strong> The sol-gel process involves the transition of a solution (sol) into a solid (gel) phase. This technique is commonly used to produce metal oxides and ceramic nanoparticles with controlled morphology.</p></li><li><p><strong>Self-Assembly:</strong> Self-assembly is a process where molecules spontaneously organize into well-defined structures without external guidance. This phenomenon is often exploited in the creation of nanostructured materials, such as liposomes and dendrimers.</p></li></ol><h2 id=characterization-of-nanomaterials>Characterization of Nanomaterials</h2><p>Characterizing nanomaterials is essential for understanding their properties and performance.
