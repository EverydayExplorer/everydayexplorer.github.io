One such trend that has taken the high fashion industry by storm is street style. Once considered a subculture, streetwear has now become a staple on the runways of top fashion houses. The influence of street style on high fashion cannot be overlooked, as it has shaped the way we perceive and consume luxury fashion today. In this blog, we will delve into the fascinating journey of how streetwear has exerted its influence on the runways and how it has transformed the fashion landscape.</p><p><strong>The Evolution of Street Style</strong></p><p>Streetwear emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s in urban cities, particularly in the United States. It was a form of self-expression for those belonging to marginalized communities and subcultures such as skaters, hip-hop artists, and graffiti artists. Initially, streetwear was characterized by its casual and comfortable nature, incorporating elements from sportswear and utilitarian apparel. The aesthetic was defined by oversized silhouettes, bold graphics, and vibrant colors.</p><p><strong>The Rise of Streetwear in Popular Culture</strong></p><p>As hip-hop gained popularity in the 1990s, so did the influence of street style. Rappers became the new trendsetters, donning baggy jeans, oversized t-shirts, and sneakers. Icons like Run-D.M.C, N.W.A, and Tupac Shakur became synonymous with streetwear, and their fashion choices began to permeate mainstream culture.</p><p><strong>Streetwear Meets High Fashion</strong></p><p>The crossover between streetwear and high fashion began in the early 2000s, as luxury brands began to take notice of the growing influence of street style. Designers such as Marc Jacobs and Hedi Slimane were among the first to embrace streetwear aesthetics and incorporate them into their collections. Their collaborations with brands like Supreme and Vans brought streetwear to the forefront of the fashion industry, blurring the lines between high fashion and street style.</p><p><strong>Streetwear as a Catalyst for Change</strong></p><p>The infusion of streetwear into high fashion brought about a significant shift in the industry. It challenged the traditional notions of luxury, which were often associated with exclusivity and elitism. Streetwear democratized fashion by making it accessible to a wider audience. Suddenly, luxury fashion was no longer confined to the wealthy and elite, but became a statement of individuality and personal style.</p><p><strong>The Impact on Runway Shows</strong></p><p>The impact of streetwear on runway shows cannot be overstated. High fashion brands started to incorporate street style elements, such as hoodies, sneakers, and graphic prints, into their collections. What was once considered casual and street-oriented was now being showcased on prestigious runways around the world. This merging of high fashion and street style created a new aesthetic that resonated with a younger, more diverse audience.</p><p><strong>The Influence of Street Style Icons</strong></p><p>Many street style icons played a crucial role in popularizing streetwear within the high fashion world. Influencers and celebrities like Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, and A Rocky became ambassadors for streetwear, collaborating with luxury brands and creating their own fashion lines. Their endorsement of street style contributed to its mainstream acceptance and solidified its position as a major force in the fashion industry.</p><p><strong>The Streetwear Effect on Luxury Brands</strong></p><p>Luxury brands have not only incorporated streetwear into their collections but have also been influenced by the streetwear mindset. They have started to embrace a more casual and urban aesthetic, designing clothes that are comfortable and functional. The emphasis has shifted from opulence and extravagance to a more relaxed and effortless style. This shift in mentality has helped luxury brands connect with a new generation of consumers who value comfort and individuality.</p><p><strong>The Future of Street Style and High Fashion</strong></p><p>Looking ahead, it is clear that street style will continue to shape the high fashion industry. The merging of these two worlds has created a dynamic and ever-evolving fashion landscape. High fashion brands will continue to draw inspiration from streetwear, pushing boundaries and reinventing traditional notions of luxury. Furthermore, streetwear will continue to evolve, remaining a powerful form of self-expression and cultural identity for many.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Street style&rsquo;s influence on high fashion is undeniable. What started as a subculture movement has now become an integral part of the global fashion industry. Streetwear has broken down barriers, challenged traditional notions of luxury, and brought a fresh perspective to high fashion. As we move forward, we can only anticipate that the influence of street style will continue to reshape the runways and push fashion into new and exciting directions.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://www.googlexy.com/categories/fashion/>Fashion</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.googlexy.com/the-influence-of-street-style-on-high-fashion/><span class=title>Â« Prev</span><br><span>The Influence of Street Style on High Fashion</span>
