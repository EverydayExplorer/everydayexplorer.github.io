LinkedIn, in particular, is designed to facilitate professional connections and offers features such as groups, messaging, and recommendations that can help you expand your network. Actively engaging with industry peers, participating in discussions, and reaching out to professionals whose work you admire can open doors to new opportunities, mentorship, and collaborations.
