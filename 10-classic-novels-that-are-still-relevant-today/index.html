Austen&rsquo;s wit, sharp social commentary, and memorable characters make &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice&rsquo; a must-read for anyone interested in timeless literary works.</p><p>2. &lsquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rsquo; by Harper Lee:</p><p>Published in 1960, &lsquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rsquo; by Harper Lee tackles themes of racial inequality, morality, and the loss of innocence. Set in the deep South during the Great Depression, the novel tells the story of Scout Finch, a young girl who learns about injustice and courage through her father&rsquo;s defense of a wrongly accused African American man. Addressing issues of racism and social injustice, &lsquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rsquo; remains an essential read, prompting readers to reflect on the ongoing fight for equality in our society.</p><p>3. &lsquo;1984&rsquo; by George Orwell:</p><p>George Orwell&rsquo;s dystopian novel, &lsquo;1984,&rsquo; published in 1949, paints a bleak picture of a totalitarian society dominated by government surveillance and control.

The novel serves as a cautionary tale, reminding readers of the importance of defending individual freedom and resisting oppressive regimes.</p><p>4. &lsquo;The Catcher in the Rye&rsquo; by J.D. Salinger:</p><p>&lsquo;The Catcher in the Rye&rsquo; by J.D. Salinger has been celebrated as a classic coming-of-age novel since its publication in 1951.
