One of the most important aspects of astrology is the Wheel of the Year, which is a cycle of eight Sabbats that mark the changing of the seasons. These Sabbats are a time for celebration, reflection, and connection with nature and the divine.</p><p>The Wheel of the Year is a powerful tool for understanding the cycles of life and death, and for connecting with the natural world. Each Sabbat has its own unique energy and symbolism, and is a time for reflection, meditation, and ritual. By honoring the Sabbats, we can deepen our connection with the natural world and with each other.</p><p>In this post, we will explore the eight Sabbats of the Wheel of the Year, and how they can be used to deepen our understanding of astrology and our place within the universe.</p><h3 id=spring-equinox-march-20-23>Spring Equinox (March 20-23)</h3><p>The Spring Equinox, also known as Ostara, marks the beginning of spring and the awakening of the earth from its winter slumber.
