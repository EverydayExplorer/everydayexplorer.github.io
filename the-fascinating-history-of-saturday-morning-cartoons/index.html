These cartoons were a staple for Saturday mornings, where kids would wake up early just to watch their favorite animated shows. The history of Saturday morning cartoons has a long and fascinating story that many people are unaware of, from its beginnings in the 1950s to its eventual decline in the 1990s.</p><p>In the early 1950s, network television was starting to gain popularity, and broadcast companies were trying to find programming that would attract younger viewers. The big three networks at the time, NBC, CBS, and ABC, were all competing for a slice of the youth market. CBS was the first network to come up with the idea of a Saturday morning cartoon block, which they called &ldquo;CBS Saturday Morning.&rdquo; The show aired in 1954 and was an immediate hit.</p><p>The success of CBS Saturday Morning encouraged other networks to follow suit. In 1962, NBC introduced &ldquo;The Jetsons&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Flintstones,&rdquo; which became two of the most popular cartoons of all time. &ldquo;The Flintstones&rdquo; was the first prime-time animated sitcom to be successful, and it paved the way for future shows like &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; and &ldquo;Family Guy.&rdquo;</p><p>By the 1970s, Saturday morning cartoons had become a cultural phenomenon. Many of the shows that aired during this time were produced by Hanna-Barbera, such as &ldquo;Scooby Doo,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Smurfs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jonny Quest.&rdquo; These shows were incredibly popular and dominated Saturday morning TV. Other popular shows during this era include &ldquo;Super Friends,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Schoolhouse Rock.&rdquo;</p><p>However, the popularity of Saturday morning cartoons also sparked controversy. Critics argued that the shows were too violent and influenced children to engage in aggressive behavior. In response, legislation was passed to regulate the content of children&rsquo;s television programming. In 1990, the Children&rsquo;s Television Act was passed, which required broadcasters to air educational programming for children and limit the amount of commercial advertising during children&rsquo;s programming.</p><p>As the 1990s progressed, the popularity of Saturday morning cartoons began to decline. The rise of cable television and the internet provided a wider variety of entertainment options for children, and networks began to experiment with different programming. The final nail in the coffin for Saturday morning cartoons came with the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which allowed broadcasters to air children&rsquo;s programming at any time instead of just on Saturday mornings.</p><p>Today, Saturday morning cartoons are a thing of the past, but their impact on popular culture is still felt today. Many people who grew up during the era of Saturday morning cartoons have fond memories of waking up early, pouring a bowl of sugary cereal, and sitting in front of the TV for hours on end. The shows that aired during this time were not just entertaining, but they also taught valuable lessons and sparked the imaginations of millions of children. They were a cultural touchstone and will always hold a special place in the hearts of those who grew up with them.</p><p>In conclusion, the history of Saturday morning cartoons is a fascinating one, from their humble beginnings in the 1950s to their eventual decline in the 1990s. These shows had a profound impact on popular culture and provided hours of entertainment for generations of children. Although they are no longer aired on Saturday mornings, their legacy lives on in the memories of those who grew up with them.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://www.googlexy.com/categories/cartoons/>Cartoons</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.googlexy.com/the-fascinating-history-of-disney-cartoons/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Fascinating History of Disney Cartoons</span>
