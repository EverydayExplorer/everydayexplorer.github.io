In this exploration of fashion in film, we will journey through various eras, examining how costumes have defined not only the characters but also the time periods they represent.</p><h2 id=the-golden-age-of-hollywood-1927-1960>The Golden Age of Hollywood (1927-1960)</h2><p>The Golden Age of Hollywood was a time of opulence and elegance, where the film industry produced some of its most memorable costumes.
