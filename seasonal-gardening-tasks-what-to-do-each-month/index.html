As the days grow longer and warmer, it&rsquo;s time to roll up your sleeves and get to work. From planting to pruning, there&rsquo;s plenty to keep you busy in the garden this month.</p><p>April is the perfect time to start sowing seeds for summer blooms and vegetables. Begin by preparing your soil, removing any weeds, and adding compost or fertilizer as needed. Once your soil is ready, it&rsquo;s time to start planting. Sow seeds for annual flowers such as marigolds, petunias, and zinnias, as well as vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers.</p><p>As the weather warms up, be sure to keep an eye on your garden&rsquo;s water needs. Most plants require about an inch of water per week, either from rainfall or irrigation. Be sure to water deeply and infrequently to encourage deep root growth.</p><p>In addition to planting, April is also a great time to tackle some pruning tasks. Remove any dead or diseased branches from trees and shrubs, and prune back any overgrown or leggy growth. This will help promote healthy growth and improve the overall appearance of your garden.</p><p>May is a busy month in the garden, with plenty of tasks to keep you busy. Start by planting warm-season annuals and vegetables, such as impatiens, begonias, and beans. Be sure to water newly planted seeds and transplants regularly to help them establish strong root systems.</p><p>May is also a great time to start thinking about your summer garden. Begin by preparing your soil, adding compost or fertilizer as needed. Once your soil is ready, start planting summer-blooming bulbs such as dahlias, gladiolus, and lilies.</p><p>In addition to planting, May is also a good time to start thinking about pest control. Keep an eye out for signs of pest damage, such as chewed leaves or holes in fruit. If you do spot pests, take action quickly to prevent them from spreading.</p><p>June is a great time to enjoy the fruits of your labor in the garden. Many plants will be in full bloom, creating a riot of color and fragrance. Be sure to deadhead flowers regularly to encourage continuous blooming.</p><p>June is also a good time to start harvesting early crops such as lettuce, radishes, and peas. Be sure to harvest regularly to encourage continued production.</p><p>In addition to harvesting, June is also a good time to start thinking about midsummer maintenance tasks. Keep an eye out for signs of heat stress in your plants, and be sure to water regularly during hot, dry weather. You may also need to provide some shade for sensitive plants to help them beat the heat.</p><p>July is typically the hottest month of the year, so be sure to take steps to protect your garden from the heat. Water early in the morning or late in the evening to reduce evaporation, and mulch around your plants to help retain moisture.</p><p>Despite the heat, there&rsquo;s still plenty to do in the garden in July. Continue to deadhead flowers and harvest vegetables regularly. You may also need to provide some extra care for heat-sensitive plants, such as providing shade or extra water.</p><p>As summer draws to a close, it&rsquo;s time to start thinking about preparing your garden for fall. Begin by removing any spent annuals and vegetables, and add them to your compost pile. You can also start planting cool-season crops such as lettuce, spinach, and kale.</p><p>In addition to planting, September is also a good time to start thinking about lawn care. Begin by aerating your lawn to improve soil drainage and reduce compaction. You can also overseed your lawn with cool-season grasses to help fill in bare patches.</p><p>As the days grow shorter and cooler, it&rsquo;s time to start thinking about preparing your garden for winter. Begin by cleaning up any debris, such as fallen leaves and dead plant material. You can also mulch around your plants to help protect them from frost.</p><p>In addition to preparing your garden for winter, November is also a good time to start planning for next year. Take some time to reflect on what worked well in your garden this year, and what you might want to change for next year. You can also start ordering seeds and supplies for next year&rsquo;s garden, so you&rsquo;ll be ready to hit the ground running when spring rolls around.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://www.googlexy.com/categories/gardening-and-horticulture/>Gardening and Horticulture</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.googlexy.com/seasonal-gardening-tasks-spring-edition/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Seasonal Gardening Tasks: Spring Edition</span>
