They are often associated with forests, mountains, and caves, and are believed to bring good fortune to those who encounter them.</p><p>The &lsquo;Raksasa&rsquo; is another mythical creature that holds a significant place in Indonesian folklore. Raksasa, which translates to &lsquo;giant&rsquo; in English, refers to a group of large and fearsome human-like creatures. These giants are often depicted as incredibly strong and have a voracious appetite. They are said to be the descendants of the gods and have played both positive and negative roles in Indonesian mythology.
