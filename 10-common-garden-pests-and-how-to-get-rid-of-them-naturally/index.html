However, many gardeners are hesitant to use chemical pesticides due to their potential harmful effects on the environment and beneficial creatures. The good news is that there are plenty of natural solutions available to help you get rid of common garden pests without resorting to harmful chemicals. In this article, we will discuss 10 common garden pests and how to deal with them naturally.</p><p>1. Aphids:<br>Aphids are tiny insects that feed on the sap of plants, resulting in distorted leaves and stunted growth. One effective method to control aphids naturally is by introducing beneficial insects such as ladybugs or lacewings, which prey on aphids. You can also make a homemade insecticidal soap by mixing a few drops of dish soap with water and spraying it on the affected plants.</p><p>2. Slugs and Snails:<br>Slugs and snails can cause extensive damage to garden plants, especially leafy greens. To naturally control these pests, consider setting up beer traps by burying shallow containers filled with beer near affected plants. Slugs and snails are attracted to the beer, and they will drown in the containers. Additionally, you can create barriers around vulnerable plants using crushed eggshells or copper tape, as slugs and snails avoid crawling over these sharp surfaces.</p><p>3. Tomato Hornworms:<br>Tomato hornworms are large green caterpillars that can quickly defoliate tomato plants. To naturally control these pests, encourage the presence of beneficial insects such as parasitic wasps or braconid wasps, which lay their eggs inside the hornworms. Handpicking the caterpillars and squishing them is also an effective and natural method of control.</p><p>4. Whiteflies:<br>Whiteflies are small, flying pests that suck the sap from plant leaves, leaving behind a sticky residue known as honeydew. To control whiteflies naturally, try spraying the affected plants with a mixture of water and neem oil. Neem oil acts as a repellent and disrupts the pests&rsquo; life cycle.</p><p>5. Cabbage Loopers:<br>Cabbage loopers are green caterpillars that feed on the leaves of plants like cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower, causing extensive damage. To naturally control these pests, use floating row covers to physically block them from reaching your plants. Alternatively, you can handpick the caterpillars or introduce beneficial insects such as parasitic wasps or tachinid flies.</p><p>6. Japanese Beetles:<br>Japanese beetles are highly destructive pests that feed on a wide range of plants, including roses, grapes, and fruit trees. A natural way to control Japanese beetles is by planting trap crops such as the Japanese beetle&rsquo;s favorite plants, including roses and beans, away from your main garden. This attracts the beetles and keeps them away from your desired plants. You can also manually remove them by shaking the beetles off the plants early in the morning when they are less active.</p><p>7. Earwigs:<br>Earwigs are nocturnal pests that feed on plant leaves, flowers, and fruits. To control earwigs naturally, place damp newspaper or cardboard traps in your garden overnight. The earwigs will seek shelter under the traps, and you can discard them the next morning. You can also create a simple trap using a small container filled with vegetable oil, soy sauce, and a few drops of dish soap.</p><p>8. Cutworms:<br>Cutworms are caterpillars that cut young plants down at the soil level. To protect your plants, create physical barriers by cutting the bottom of plastic cups and placing them around the base of each seedling. This will prevent the cutworms from reaching your plants. Additionally, you can use beneficial nematodes, a microscopic worm that naturally controls cutworm populations.</p><p>9. Squash Bugs:<br>Squash bugs are common pests that attack plants in the cucurbit family, including squash, pumpkins, and zucchinis. To control squash bugs naturally, inspect the undersides of leaves and remove any egg masses you find. You can also encourage beneficial insects such as tachinid flies and parasitic wasps that prey on squash bugs. Planting companion plants like marigolds or tansy can also help deter these pests.</p><p>10. Scale Insects:<br>Scale insects are small, immobile pests that suck sap from plant foliage, leaving behind a sticky residue. To naturally control scale insects, use a soft brush or cloth dipped in rubbing alcohol to scrub the insects off the affected plants. Introducing natural predators such as ladybugs or lacewings can also help manage scale infestations.</p><p>By using natural methods to control garden pests, you can maintain a healthy and thriving garden while minimizing harm to the environment. From introducing beneficial insects to employing physical barriers, there are numerous effective and eco-friendly ways to deal with common garden pests. So the next time pests invade your garden, try these natural solutions and keep your plants thriving without resorting to chemical pesticides.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://www.googlexy.com/categories/gardening-and-horticulture/>Gardening and Horticulture</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.googlexy.com/10-common-garden-pests-and-how-to-deal-with-them/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>10 Common Garden Pests and How to Deal with Them</span>
