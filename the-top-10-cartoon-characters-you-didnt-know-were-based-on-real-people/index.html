They have the unique ability to captivate people of all ages, with their colorful worlds and relatable characters. But have you ever wondered if these characters were based on real people? In this blog post, we will explore the top 10 cartoon characters you didn&rsquo;t know were based on real people.</p><p>2. Bugs Bunny - Groucho Marx</p><p>Believe it or not, Bugs Bunny, one of the most iconic characters in the world of animation, was inspired by Groucho Marx, a legendary comedian and actor from the golden age of Hollywood. The similarities between the two are unmistakable, from their witty humor and sarcasm to their distinctive noses and eyebrows.</p><p>3. Daffy Duck - Leon Schwartz</p><p>Daffy Duck, the temperamental and hilarious duck, was reportedly based on Leon Schwartz, a Warner Bros. animator who worked on the character&rsquo;s design. Schwartz&rsquo;s personality was said to be a major influence on Daffy&rsquo;s character, with his quick wit and occasional mood swings.</p><p>4. Mickey Mouse - Walt Disney</p><p>It&rsquo;s no secret that Mickey Mouse, the world&rsquo;s most famous mouse, was inspired by Walt Disney himself. Disney&rsquo;s love for animals and his desire to create a character that would represent his company led him to create Mickey, who eventually became the face of Disney.</p><p>5. Donald Duck - Carl Stalling</p><p>Another iconic Disney character, Donald Duck, was inspired by Carl Stalling, a composer and director who worked for Warner Bros. Stalling&rsquo;s temperament and quirky personality were said to be the inspiration behind Donald&rsquo;s character.</p><p>6. Tom and Jerry - Felix the Cat</p><p>The famous cat and mouse duo, Tom and Jerry, were inspired by Felix the Cat, one of the first cartoon stars in the world of animation. Felix&rsquo;s antics and interactions with various characters laid the groundwork for the humor and chaos that would later become synonymous with Tom and Jerry.</p><p>7. Scooby-Doo - Fred Flintstone</p><p>Scooby-Doo, the lovable Great Dane, was reportedly inspired by none other than Fred Flintstone, the main character from the popular animated series The Flintstones. The creators of Scooby-Doo were said to be fans of The Flintstones and wanted to create a character that would be just as memorable and beloved.</p><p>8. Wile E. Coyote - Chuck Jones</p><p>Wile E. Coyote, the persistent and resourceful coyote from the Looney Tunes series, was inspired by Chuck Jones, the animator and director who created the character. Jones&rsquo; own determination and resourcefulness were said to have played a significant role in shaping Wile E. Coyote&rsquo;s character.</p><p>9. Porky Pig - Mel Blanc</p><p>Porky Pig, the lovable and slightly bumbling pig, was inspired by Mel Blanc, the legendary voice actor who gave life to countless iconic cartoon characters. Blanc&rsquo;s distinctive voice and personality were said to have been the inspiration behind Porky&rsquo;s character.</p><p>10. Yosemite Sam - Billy Bletcher</p><p>Yosemite Sam, the hot-headed and trigger-happy cowboy, was inspired by Billy Bletcher, an animator and voice actor who worked on the character. Bletcher&rsquo;s own temperament and voice were said to have been the inspiration behind Sam&rsquo;s character.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>These are just a few examples of the many cartoon characters that have been inspired by real people. While some of these inspirations may be more apparent than others, it&rsquo;s fascinating to see how the creators of these iconic characters drew from their own experiences and the people around them to bring these beloved characters to life.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://www.googlexy.com/categories/cartoons/>Cartoons</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.googlexy.com/the-top-10-cartoon-catchphrases-that-became-legendary/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Top 10 Cartoon Catchphrases That Became Legendary</span>
