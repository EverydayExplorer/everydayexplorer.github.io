Cucumber Hummus Cups:</strong> For a light and refreshing appetizer, try these cucumber hummus cups. Slice English cucumbers into thick rounds, then use a melon baller or spoon to scoop out the center, creating a cup shape.

These bite-sized cups are not only delicious but also low-carb and gluten-free, making them perfect for guests with dietary restrictions.</p><p><strong>4. Grilled Shrimp Skewers:</strong> Fire up the grill and impress your guests with these flavorful grilled shrimp skewers. Marinate jumbo shrimp in a mixture of olive oil, minced garlic, lemon zest, and fresh herbs—I like to use parsley, thyme, and oregano—for at least 30 minutes. Thread the marinated shrimp onto skewers, then grill over medium-high heat until pink and opaque, about 2-3 minutes per side. Serve with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a sprinkle of chopped parsley for a simple yet elegant appetizer that&rsquo;s sure to please.</p><p><strong>5.

The sweet and savory flavors of this salsa are sure to be a hit with your guests.</p><p><strong>6. Prosciutto-Wrapped Asparagus Spears:</strong> Elevate your appetizer game with these elegant prosciutto-wrapped asparagus spears. Start by blanching asparagus spears in boiling water for 1-2 minutes, then immediately transfer them to an ice bath to stop the cooking process. Once cooled, wrap each asparagus spear with a slice of prosciutto and secure with a toothpick. Arrange the wrapped asparagus spears on a serving platter and drizzle with balsamic glaze for a savory and sophisticated appetizer that&rsquo;s perfect for summer entertaining.</p><p><strong>7. Greek Yogurt Veggie Dip:</strong> Keep things light and healthy with this creamy Greek yogurt veggie dip. In a bowl, combine Greek yogurt with minced garlic, lemon juice, chopped fresh dill, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir until smooth and creamy, then serve with an assortment of fresh veggies such as baby carrots, cucumber slices, cherry tomatoes, and bell pepper strips. This dip is not only delicious but also packed with protein and probiotics, making it a guilt-free option for summer entertaining.</p><p><strong>8.

Cut a pineapple in half lengthwise and hollow out the center, then dice the pineapple flesh and combine it with diced red bell pepper, red onion, jalapeño pepper, cilantro, and freshly squeezed lime juice. Spoon the pineapple salsa into the hollowed-out pineapple halves and garnish with a sprig of fresh mint for a colorful and festive appetizer that&rsquo;s sure to impress your guests.</p><p><strong>9.
