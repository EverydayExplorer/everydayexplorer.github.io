Some of the main types of inorganic compounds include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Metals</strong>: Metals are elements characterized by their ability to conduct heat and electricity, as well as their malleability and ductility. Common metals include iron, copper, and aluminum. These elements often form ionic compounds with nonmetals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ionic Compounds</strong>: These compounds are composed of cations and anions held together by ionic bonds. Sodium chloride (table salt) is a classic example of an ionic compound, consisting of positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Covalent Compounds</strong>: Inorganic covalent compounds involve the sharing of electrons between nonmetals. Examples include water (H(_2)O) and sulfur dioxide (SO(_2)).</p></li><li><p><strong>Coordination Compounds</strong>: Coordination compounds, also known as complex compounds, consist of a central metal atom or ion surrounded by ligandsâ€”molecules or ions that can donate electron pairs. A well-known coordination compound is hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in our blood.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oxides</strong>: Oxides are compounds that contain oxygen in combination with other elements. Common examples include carbon dioxide (CO(_2)) and silicon dioxide (SiO(_2)).</p></li><li><p><strong>Salts</strong>: Salts are ionic compounds formed by the neutralization of an acid and a base.
