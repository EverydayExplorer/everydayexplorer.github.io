This ancient fortress has a dark and mysterious past, making it a perfect setting for ghostly tales. Countless apparitions have been reported throughout the castle, including a phantom piper who can be heard playing his bagpipes, eerie lights appearing in windows, and ghostly soldiers who vanish into thin air.
