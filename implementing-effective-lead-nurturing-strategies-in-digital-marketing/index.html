The buying journey consists of three key stages: awareness, consideration, and decision.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Awareness</strong>: At this stage, potential customers become aware of a problem or a need they have. They start researching and looking for information to better understand their situation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consideration</strong>: In the consideration stage, potential customers have already identified their problem and are looking for potential solutions. They evaluate different options and compare them to find the one that best suits their needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decision</strong>: The decision stage is where potential customers make their final choice and become paying customers. They have already done their research and are ready to make a purchase.</p></li></ol><h2 id=the-role-of-lead-nurturing>The Role of Lead Nurturing</h2><p>Lead nurturing plays a crucial role in guiding potential customers through these stages of the buying journey. It involves delivering relevant and timely information to prospects, building trust, and establishing your business as an authority in the industry.
