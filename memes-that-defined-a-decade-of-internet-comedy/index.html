These viral sensations have dominated our social media feeds and have become a significant part of online culture. Memes have the power to bring people together, spark laughter, and often provide commentary on society. As we reflect on the past decade, it&rsquo;s impossible to ignore the memes that have defined a generation of internet comedy. Join me as we delve into some of the most iconic and influential memes of the past 10 years.</p><h2 id=1-distracted-boyfriend>1. &lsquo;Distracted Boyfriend&rsquo;</h2><p>One of the most widely recognizable memes of the decade, &lsquo;Distracted Boyfriend,&rsquo; gained popularity in 2017 and quickly spread like wildfire. The image, featuring a man turning around to ogle another woman while his girlfriend looks on in disbelief, perfectly captures the idea of being tempted by something new. This meme became a symbol for infidelity and disloyalty, often used to mock situations where someone is distracted by other options.</p><h2 id=2-doge>2. &lsquo;Doge&rsquo;</h2><p>Doge, the Shiba Inu dog with captions written in broken English Comic Sans, became an internet sensation in 2013. The dog&rsquo;s adorable face and quirky captions took over the internet, generating countless variations and spin-offs. Doge quickly became an iconic part of meme culture, with phrases like &lsquo;such wow&rsquo; and &lsquo;very meme&rsquo; becoming staples of internet lingo.</p><h2 id=3-arthur-fist>3. &lsquo;Arthur Fist&rsquo;</h2><p>The &lsquo;Arthur Fist&rsquo; meme originated from a screenshot of Arthur, the beloved children&rsquo;s show character, clenching his fist in frustration. This image became a symbol of determination and resolve in the face of adversity, with users adding their own captions to express their frustrations or determination to overcome obstacles.</p><h2 id=4-pepe-the-frog>4. &lsquo;Pepe the Frog&rsquo;</h2><p>Initially created as a character in a webcomic, Pepe the Frog gained popularity as a widespread internet meme. However, in recent years, it has been associated with extremism and hate speech, which led to its decline in mainstream usage. Despite its controversial nature later on, there is no denying the impact Pepe the Frog had on meme culture throughout the early 2010s.</p><h2 id=5-surprised-pikachu>5. &lsquo;Surprised Pikachu&rsquo;</h2><p>When a trailer for the &lsquo;Detective Pikachu&rsquo; movie was released in 2019, one particular shot of Pikachu looking surprised went viral. The &lsquo;Surprised Pikachu&rsquo; meme became a versatile reaction image, used to express shock or disbelief. This meme quickly spread across the internet, with users using it to mock things that should be obvious but still manage to surprise us.</p><h2 id=6-mocking-spongebob>6. &lsquo;Mocking SpongeBob&rsquo;</h2><p>The &lsquo;Mocking SpongeBob&rsquo; meme took the internet by storm in 2017, originating from a scene in the beloved animated show. The screenshot, featuring SpongeBob mocking someone by alternating uppercase and lowercase letters, was a perfect representation of how people would imitate others online. This meme found its way into countless replies on social media, making it one of the most relatable internet comedy sensations of the decade.</p><h2 id=7-woman-yelling-at-a-cat>7. &lsquo;Woman Yelling at a Cat&rsquo;</h2><p>Combining two separate images—one of a woman yelling and another of a confused-looking cat—this meme exploded in popularity in 2019. The contrasting emotions captured in the image led to endless possibilities for humorous captions. This meme perfectly encapsulated the internet&rsquo;s ability to take unrelated images and create hilarious situations.</p><h2 id=8-this-is-fine>8. &lsquo;This is Fine&rsquo;</h2><p>Originating from a webcomic called &lsquo;Gunshow,&rsquo; the &lsquo;This is Fine&rsquo; meme gained traction as a reaction image in 2016. The image depicts a dog sitting in a room engulfed in flames while calmly saying, &lsquo;This is fine.&rsquo; This meme became a way for people to express resignation and acceptance in the face of chaos or adversity, making it relatable and enduring.</p><h2 id=9-harambe>9. &lsquo;Harambe&rsquo;</h2><p>The tragic incident involving the gorilla named Harambe in 2016 sparked intense debate and controversy. However, it also became a meme that spread like wildfire. Harambe&rsquo;s image was used as a symbol of remembrance, often paired with humorous or absurd captions as a form of internet humor. While the meme initially faced backlash due to the sensitive nature of the incident, it gained traction and became a defining meme of the time.</p><h2 id=10-baby-yoda>10. &lsquo;Baby Yoda&rsquo;</h2><p>In 2019, the Disney+ series &lsquo;The Mandalorian&rsquo; introduced an adorable, wide-eyed character colloquially known as Baby Yoda. This irresistibly cute creature quickly took the internet by storm. The &lsquo;Baby Yoda&rsquo; meme captured everyone&rsquo;s hearts, with the character appearing in countless situations, often expressing various emotions or referencing popular culture. Baby Yoda became an immediate icon within meme culture, and it is undoubtedly one of the most beloved memes of the past decade.</p><p>These memes, among many others, have left an indelible mark on internet comedy and have contributed to the rich tapestry of online culture. They have the power to evoke laughter, nostalgia, and a sense of camaraderie among internet users. As we look back on the past decade, it&rsquo;s clear that memes have become an integral part of our digital lives. They continue to shape and redefine humor in the online sphere, promising even more laughs and unforgettable moments in the years to come.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://www.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-satire/>Comedy and Satire</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.googlexy.com/mastering-timing-in-stand-up-comedy-the-key-to-landing-jokes/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Mastering Timing in Stand-Up Comedy: The Key to Landing Jokes</span>
