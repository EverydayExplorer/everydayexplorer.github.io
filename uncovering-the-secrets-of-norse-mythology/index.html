He is associated with wisdom, war, and poetry. Odin is often depicted as an elderly man with one eye, as he sacrificed an eye to gain wisdom from the Well of Urd. He is also known for his trademark spear, Gungnir, and his mighty horse, Sleipnir.</p><h4 id=thor>Thor</h4><p>Thor, the god of thunder and strength, is one of the most well-known figures in Norse mythology. He wields the powerful hammer, Mjolnir, which was forged by the dwarves and has the ability to level mountains.
