From the famous sweet wines of Tokaji to the robust reds of Egri Bikavér, Hungary offers a diverse and exciting wine landscape that is just waiting to be explored.</p><p>One of Hungary&rsquo;s most renowned wine regions is Tokaj, located in the northeast part of the country. Tokaj has been producing wine since at least the 12th century and is known for its unique and delicious sweet wines. These wines are made from grapes that have been affected by the noble rot fungus, which concentrates the sugars and flavors in the grapes. The result is a luscious and complex wine with notes of apricot, honey, and dried fruits. The most famous of these wines is the Tokaji Aszú, which is often referred to as the &lsquo;wine of kings&rsquo;. Tokaji Aszú was even once referred to as the &lsquo;wine of the czars&rsquo; by Louis XIV of France.</p><p>In addition to the sweet wines, Tokaj also produces dry and off-dry whites that are equally as impressive. Furmint, Hárslevelü, and Sárgamuskotály are the key grape varieties used in these wines, and they offer a crisp and refreshing alternative to the sweet wines for those who prefer a drier style.</p><p>Another wine region worth exploring in Hungary is Eger, located in the northern part of the country. Eger is known for its rich and full-bodied red wines, particularly Egri Bikavér, also known as Bull&rsquo;s Blood. Legend has it that the name Egri Bikavér came from a 16th-century battle when the defenders of Eger successfully repelled the invading Ottomans. In order to boost their soldiers&rsquo; morale, the defenders drank copious amounts of red wine, which stained their beards red and made them appear fierce and invincible. The Ottomans thought they had been drinking bull&rsquo;s blood and retreated in fear.</p><p>Egri Bikavér is a blend of multiple grape varieties, including Kékfrankos (Blaufränkisch), Kadarka, and Merlot, among others. The resulting wines are medium to full-bodied, with flavors of dark fruits, spices, and a touch of earthiness. These wines are often aged in oak barrels, which adds complexity and texture to the final product.</p><p>Apart from Tokaj and Eger, there are other wine regions in Hungary that deserve recognition. Villány, located in the southern part of the country, is known for its full-bodied red wines made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and other Bordeaux grape varieties. Somló, a small volcanic hill in the western part of Hungary, produces unique white wines made from the Furmint and Hárslevelü grapes. Balaton, Hungary&rsquo;s largest lake, is surrounded by vineyards and offers a variety of wines, both red and white.</p><p>When it comes to exploring the wines of Hungary, there are several ways to go about it. One option is to visit the wineries in person and experience the beauty of the Hungarian countryside while tasting the wines firsthand. Many wineries offer guided tours and tastings, allowing visitors to learn about the winemaking process and the unique characteristics of Hungarian wines. Another option is to seek out Hungarian wines at specialty wine shops or online retailers. There are many importers who specialize in Hungarian wines and can provide a wide selection for you to choose from.</p><p>In recent years, Hungarian wines have been gaining recognition and acclaim on the international stage. The unique character and exceptional quality of these wines are earning them a place among the world&rsquo;s best. So, the next time you&rsquo;re looking to try something new and exciting in the world of wine, consider exploring the wines of Hungary. From the sweet wines of Tokaji to the robust reds of Egri Bikavér, there is a flavor profile to suit every palate.
