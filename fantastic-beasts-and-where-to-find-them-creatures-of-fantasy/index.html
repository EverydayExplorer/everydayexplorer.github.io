Rowling first introduced the world of Harry Potter, she created a rich and complex reality that included not only human witches and wizards, but also a vast array of magical creatures. From the well-known pets like owls, cats, and toads, to the fearsome beasts like dragons, giants, and trolls, to the hidden wonders like unicorns, centaurs, and merpeople, the Hogwarts universe was teeming with life beyond human imagination. Yet, even with seven books and eight movies, fans of the franchise still hungered for more, especially when it came to the question of what other creatures might lurk in the broader wizarding world. Fortunately, Rowling decided to offer a partial answer in the form of a spin-off book called Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which was later adapted into a film series of the same name. In this blog, we will explore some of the most fascinating creatures of fantasy that appear in the Fantastic Beasts franchise, from the adorable to the grotesque, from the familiar to the exotic, and from the harmless to the deadly.</p><p>Basilisk: Let&rsquo;s start with a classic monster that has been mentioned before in the Harry Potter series but never seen until the second Fantastic Beasts movie. The basilisk is a giant snake that can petrify or kill anyone who looks into its eyes. In the film, we learn that the basilisk is not only a rare, dangerous creature but also a key to defeating the dark wizard Grindelwald, who seeks to rule over both the magical and non-magical worlds. The basilisk in Fantastic Beasts is visually stunning, with iridescent scales, glowing eyes, and powerful movements that make it a formidable foe. However, it&rsquo;s also tragic in a way, since it&rsquo;s revealed that its true nature and potential have been exploited and corrupted by dark magic.</p><p>Bowtruckle: A much gentler creature that steals many scenes in both movies is the Bowtruckle, a tiny and shy creature that looks like a leafy twig with eyes and arms. Bowtruckles are guardians of trees and can be found hiding in the branches, making nests, and nibbling on insects. In Fantastic Beasts, we see a famished Bowtruckle named Pickett who becomes attached to the protagonist Newt Scamander and helps him in his adventures. Pickett is adorable, expressive, and loyal, and his movements and chirps are hilarious to watch. Bowtruckles are a great example of how even the smallest creatures in the magical world can have a meaningful role and personality.</p><p>Chupacabra: This creature is not a new invention of Rowling but a legendary cryptid from Latin America. The Chupacabra is said to be a small, lizard-like creature with spines on its back, a forked tongue, and a taste for blood. In Fantastic Beasts 2, we see a few Chupacabras inhabiting a circus run by dark wizards. Although they are presented as fearsome and dangerous, they also have a humorous side, as they are easily distracted by shiny things and can be tamed by a skilled animal trainer. The use of real-life folklore creatures like the Chupacabra adds a layer of cultural diversity and wonder to the Fantastic Beasts canon.</p><p>Erumpent: One of the more bizarre and fascinating creatures in the franchise is the Erumpent, a massive creature that resembles a rhinoceros crossed with a dinosaur. Erumpents have a dangerous horn that can explode with a fiery blast if provoked or excited, and they are known for their highly aggressive mating rituals. In Fantastic Beasts, we see Newt Scamander trying to contain a rampaging Erumpent in New York City, which leads to a chaotic sequence of destruction. The Erumpent is both awe-inspiring and frightening, with its armored skin, glowing eyes, and thunderous roar. It&rsquo;s also a clever metaphor for the danger of unchecked passion and desire, as the Erumpent&rsquo;s reproductive behavior is a comic exaggeration of human obsessions.</p><p>Niffler: Last but not least, we have the breakout star of the Fantastic Beasts franchise, the Niffler. This small, furry creature with a long snout and a love for shiny objects is Newt Scamander&rsquo;s loyal companion and an endless source of comedy. Nifflers are apparently bred by goblins for their skills in detecting treasures, and they can pouch a seemingly endless amount of valuables in their pouches. In both movies, we see Nifflers causing chaos in banks, jewelry stores, and even in a bookshop. The Niffler is not only adorable but also relatable, as anyone who has ever been tempted by material possessions can understand its urge to hoard. The popularity of the Niffler has spawned many fan artworks, merchandise, and even a spin-off video game.</p><p>In conclusion, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has expanded the already vast world of Harry Potter by introducing us to a whole new set of creatures of fantasy. From the deadly basilisk to the adorable Niffler, these creatures add depth, humor, and imagination to the wizarding world and remind us of the power of storytelling. As the franchise continues with the third movie, we can expect to see even more beasts of wonder and horror, and who knows, maybe some of them will become as beloved as the Niffler.</p><p>Keywords: Fantastic Beasts, creatures, fantasy, Harry Potter, JK Rowling, basilisk, Bowtruckle, Chupacabra, Erumpent, Niffler, spin-off, movie, franchise, magic, visual, diversity, metaphor, humor, pop culture.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://www.googlexy.com/categories/science-fiction-and-fantasy/>Science Fiction and Fantasy</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.googlexy.com/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-creatures-in-fantasy-literature/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: Creatures in Fantasy Literature</span>
