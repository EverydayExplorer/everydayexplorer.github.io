Accessibility: Online learning has made education more accessible than ever before. It eliminates geographical limitations, allowing lifelong learners to access courses and programs from top institutions around the world. Regardless of where you live, you can access a wide range of courses and resources without having to travel or relocate.</p><p>3. Variety of Courses: Online learning platforms offer a vast array of courses, ranging from academic subjects to professional skills development.
