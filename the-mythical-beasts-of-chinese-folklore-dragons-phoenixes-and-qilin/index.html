Qilin is known for its benevolent nature and is considered the harbinger of good fortune, serenity, and longevity.</p><p>In Chinese mythology, the appearance of a qilin is regarded as an omen of auspicious events. It is believed to only show itself during the reign of a wise and just ruler. The qilin is also associated with protecting the innocent and punishing the wicked, making it a symbol of justice and righteousness.</p><p>Similar to dragons and phoenixes, the qilin is a popular subject in Chinese art and is often depicted as an elegant and graceful creature.
